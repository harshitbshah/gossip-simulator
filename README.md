Description:
Created a gossip simulator based on actors written in Elixir to determine the convergence of Gossip and Push-Sum algorithms over Full, Linear, 2D and imperfect 2D (one random extra neighbor) network topologies

Project Implementation:
Project2 numNodes {full | 3D | line | imp3D} {gossip | push-sum}

Working:
1. Convergence of Gossip Algorithm for all topologies
2. Convergence of Push-Sum Algorithm for all topologies

Largest Network Used:
1. For Gossip Protocol:
a) Full Network Topology: 100,000 nodes
b) 2D Topology: 100,000 nodes
c) Imperfect 2D Topology: 100,000 nodes
d) Line Topology: 100,000 nodes

2. For Push-Sum Algorithm:
a) Full Network Topology: 100,000 nodes
b) 2D Topology: 1000 nodes
c) Imperfect 2D Topology: 100,000 nodes
d) Line Topology: 400 nodes
